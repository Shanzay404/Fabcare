                <h2>What are the Biggest Issues for Elderly People in Our Society?</h2>
                <div class="section-heading">
                    <h4> We are well known that as a society we are living much longer thanks to improved living conditions and health care.</h4>
                </div>
                <p>We are well known that as a society we are living much longer thanks to improved living conditions and health care. While people being able to reach old age is something to be thankful for, in many ways, there are several challenges facing elderly people, which we all need to pay more attention to. Often it is not until we start to age ourselves or we see a loved one struggling that we sit up and take notice but as a society, we can do more to make life easier and better for our Seniors population. This article outlines the biggest challenges that elderly people face today in our society and how we can support them and enable them to age with dignity.</p>

                    <div class="section-heading">
                    <h4>Ageism and a lost sense of Seniors</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-8 col-sm-12 py-3">

                </div>
                <p>There are lots of outdated stereotypes and Thoughts about elderly people, which can lead to isolation and marginalization in a lot of communities. By coming up with innovative ways for older people in the community through social events, we can not only help them to maintain a sense of importance identity, and self-esteem and take advantage of the wealth of knowledge and experience they have, which is so vital for the development of society.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="section-heading">
                    <h4>Difficulty with everyday tasks and mobility</h4>
                </div>

                </div>
                <p>A person's mobility and dexterity will naturally decline as they age increases, which makes completing everyday tasks more difficult. This can cause gradually people to care for themselves and prevents them from being social, pursuing interests, or taking part in activities they enjoy. More support is needed to enable elderly people not only to live independently through Activities and programs which focus on safety, balance, fitness, and mobility but also to ensure that they can continue to thrive as an individual person.</p>

                    <div class="section-heading">
                    <h4>Finding the right care provision</h4>

                </div>
                <p>When complete independence is no longer practical, many elderly people need additional care. Many times this care can be provided by family members, but this can place a lot of strain on the caregiver in terms of balancing elderly care with work and other family responsibilities. These caregivers need to be given the training, resources, and emotional support necessary to help them deliver the best care service for their loved ones and themselves. In some cases, it is more appropriate for a professional caregiver to be employed on a regular basis, e.g., when they are complex medical conditions and/or physical disabilities. With a comprehensive elderly care service, the elderly person is able to remain in their own home.</p>

                <p>Healthcare can be Difficult and disjointed for elderly people, especially for those struggling with long-term conditions. The care requires lots of different medical professionals and Health carer to coordinate the delivery of medication and other types of care.</p>

                <p>We all need to prepare for the inevitable time, but death is often a difficult topic for people to discuss and make plans for. Elderly individual and their families need support when considering the end-of-life options available, and financial implications, and ensure that the individual's wishes are respected.</p>
